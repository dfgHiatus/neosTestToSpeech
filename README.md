# neosTextToSpeech
A text-to-speech application for use in NeosVR. Powered by Google TTS and Python 3.8.6.

To use, download the .EXE and run it (Source is available for our Linux friends). As long as the terminal stays open, it should be running fine. With the .EXE open, go to my public folder "dfg's Contraptions" and spawn a copy of neosTTS. Connect to the websocket with you as the user, and go crazy.
